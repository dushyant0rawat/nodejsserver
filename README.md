**node.js https server**  
if openssl is not installed, openssl which come with git can be used

add certificate to the root store. Certutil require administer permissions so run gitbash as administrator  
[certutil](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/administration/windows-commands/certutil)  
certutil -addstore root cert.pem  

remove certificate button is greyed in chrome unless chrome was run as administrator  

run the following commands openssl commands to create x509 certificate  
* openssl genrsa -out key.pem  
* openssl req -new -key key.pem -out csr.pem  
* openssl x509 -req -days 9999 -in csr.pem -signkey key.pem -out cert.pem  -extfile extfile.cnf  
* certutil -addstore root cert.pem  

Couldn't install self certificate without root to /system/etc/security/cacerts/ on android for use in flutter app.
so loaded cert.pem to the asset folder in flutter app to be used in httpclient of dart.io package.  

PKCS#12(PKCS12 or PFX)  is a binary format for storing a certificate chain and private key in a single file,, encryptable file. To create pkcs12 using openssl git is  
winpty openssl pkcs12 -inkey key.pem -in cert.pem -export -out keystore.p12  

To output p12 certificate:  
winpty openssl pkcs12 -info -in keystore.p12  

gitbash hangs if winpty is not used before openssl.  

In order to access the node.js website on private network from public network, do port forwarding on the router and enable "Node.js JavaScript Runtime" in windows firewall defender.   

[Let's Encrypt trusted certificates](https://www.howtoforge.com/getting-started-with-acmesh-lets-encrypt-client/)
Letâ€™s Encrypt (LE) is a certificate authority (CA) that offers free and automated SSL/TLS certificates, with the goal of encrypting the entire web. If you own a domain name and have shell access to your server you can utilize Let's Encrypt to obtain a trusted certificate at no cost. Let's Encrypt can issue SAN certs for up to 100 hostnames and wildcard certificates.  

Acme.sh installation  
curl https://get.acme.sh | sh  

Issue an SSL cert   
acme.sh --issue -d example.com -d www.example.com -d mail.example.com --webroot /var/www/example.com  

remember to not use spaces in the directory name of the webroot otherwise client can't write to the acme-challenge directory and verification would fail with return code 404. Finally able to find after many tries using --debug flag in acme.sh that client was trying to write to 'websites' instead of 'my websites'. So changing the directory to my-websites(without spaces) made acme.sh issue the certificates.  

**SSH to copy files to remote host**
- generate keys and store the private on the local computer and public key on the remote host
- create an identity file with name config on the local computer in the signed user directory in folder .ssh
- the structure of the identity file is:<br>
```
Host <host identifier, doesn't have to domain name, for example, myremotehost>
  HostName <ip address>
  User <user name on the remote host>
  Port <port>  
  IdentityFile <location of the private key file, for example, ~/.ssh/id_rsa  
  IdentitiesOnly yes
```
- login to the remote host using SSH command and host in the identity file using:<br>
```ssh myremotehost```
- using scp to copy files to remote hostname<br>
```scp <local file> myremotehost:~<remote folder>```
